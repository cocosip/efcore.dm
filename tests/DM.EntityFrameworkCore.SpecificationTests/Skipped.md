# Specification Suite Skip Ledger

Status: **living document**. Every case that does not run, or does not pass, is listed here with the
measurement that decided it. A row leaves this file when the suite passes the case, not when someone
intends to fix it.

The suite is not part of the offline gate: `BuiltInDataTypesDmTest` needs a running Dameng instance. The
store creates the tables of its own model and drops only those tables and sequences, so the database it
runs against keeps every object an application already has.

Measured on 2026-11-11 against DM 8.1.4.80, `COMPATIBLE_MODE` 2: 32 cases, 31 passed, 1 failed. The
failure is below, and it is the whole of the gap this fixture set exposes.

The store generated fixture set (`StoreGeneratedDmTest`, 211 cases) ran against the same instance on
2026-11-11 and every case passed, so it adds no entry here.

The `Where` set of the Northwind query suite (`NorthwindWhereQueryDmTest`, 408 cases) ran against the
same instance on 2026-11-11 and every case passed, so it adds no entry either. Nine of its cases
compare two constructed values, which the relational pipeline does not translate for any provider; the
class asserts that failure, as the SQL Server test does, so those cases pass as written (EF Core issue
#14672).

## Cases that do not pass

| Case | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Can_perform_query_with_max_length` | The case compares a `byte[9000]` with the equality operator, and this server cannot do both ends of that: mapped to `VARBINARY(9000)`, as the reference provider maps it, the value is refused with `记录超长`, because a row cannot hold what the type declares — measured on a one column table, 7500 bytes were stored and 8000 failed; mapped to a `BLOB`, which is what a byte array past that ceiling becomes, the statement is refused with `字符串过长`, because a large object compares with `DBMS_LOB.COMPARE` rather than with an operator | Not a provider defect: a large value must be a large object, and a large object has no equality operator. The case is inapplicable as written. The insert of the same row does pass now, since the oversized byte array is a `BLOB` rather than a column that cannot hold it |

`Case` names are methods of the test classes this project owns. `DM.EntityFrameworkCore.SpecificationTests.SkipLedgerTests`
fails when a row names a case the suite does not have.

## Cases that do not run

None. Every case of the three bases ran in the measurements above; the four capability answers in the
`BuiltInDataTypesDmTest` fixture narrow what the model contains rather than skipping a case.

`SupportsLargeStringComparisons`, `SupportsBinaryKeys`, `SupportsUnicodeToAnsiConversion` and
`PreservesDateTimeKind` are answered in the fixture rather than here, because they describe the server
rather than the suite. Each answer is a measured fact and the reason is beside the property.
